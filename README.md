# Authentication App  🔒 🔓 
An authentication app is a software application designed to provide an additional layer of security for user accounts by generating time-based, 
one-time passwords (TOTPs) or verification codes. These codes are used alongside traditional passwords to verify the identity of users during the 
login process, ensuring enhanced protection against unauthorized access. 

I used Firebase Authentication for Login, Sign up and Forget Password using Firebase Authentication.
